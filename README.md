# EthAvax2Module
The PasswordManager smart contract is a basic Ethereum smart contract written in Solidity. It allows users to save and retrieve passwords associated with their Ethereum addresses. 
This contract enables users to save passwords associated with their Ethereum addresses and retrieve those passwords later. However, there are some important security considerations that need to be addressed before using such a contract in a production environment. Storing passwords in plain text is generally not recommended due to security vulnerabilities. 
# Deployment and compilation 
1. This line imports the ethers library from Hardhat. The ethers library provides a collection of utilities for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts and blockchain data.
2. async function main() { ... }
This defines an async function named main(), which is the entry point of the script.

3. const [deployer] = await ethers.getSigners();
This line retrieves the Ethereum accounts (signers) available in the Hardhat environment. In this case, it's using destructuring to assign the first account to the deployer variable.

4.console.log("Deploying contract with the account:", deployer.address);
This line logs the address of the deployer account to the console.

5.const PasswordManager = await ethers.getContractFactory("PasswordManager");
This line retrieves the contract factory for the PasswordManager contract using the ethers library. The factory is used to deploy new instances of the contract.

6.const passwordManager = await PasswordManager.deploy();
This line deploys an instance of the PasswordManager contract using the contract factory obtained in the previous step.

7. console.log("PasswordManager deployed to:", passwordManager.address);
This line logs the address of the deployed PasswordManager contract to the console.

8. main().then(() => process.exit(0)).catch((error) => { ... });
This line calls the main() function, initiating the deployment process. After the deployment is complete, the script exits with status 0 if successful. If an error occurs during the deployment, it's caught and logged to the console, and the script exits with status 1.

The script is essentially a deployment script that interacts with the Hardhat environment to deploy the PasswordManager contract to the Ethereum network. Before running the script, you need to make sure you have the Hardhat environment set up correctly, including the necessary configuration files and Ethereum network connections.
